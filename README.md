Online Voting System  
This is a simple Web Application project where users can register, log in, and vote for candidates.  
It is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**  
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)  
Server Dependencies: express, mongoose, cors, body-parser

üöÄ **How to Set Up and Run Locally**  
1. Clone the Repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/pal1avitanwar/OnlineVotingSystem.git`  
2. Navigate to the Project Directory  
   `cd OnlineVotingSystem`  
3. Install Backend Dependencies  
   `npm install`  
4. Start the Server  
   `node server.js`  
   The server will start at:  
   `http://localhost:5000`  
5. Open the Frontend  
   Go to the **frontend/** folder.  
   Open the **index.html** file manually in your browser.

üìé **Important Notes**  
- The backend uses Express.js APIs to manage users, candidates, and votes.  
- MongoDB is used for storing user, candidate, and vote data.  
- Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed before running the project.  
- The `.env` file should contain the MongoDB URI if you're using one. If not, it will connect automatically in **server.js**.
